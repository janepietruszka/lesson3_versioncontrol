            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Version Control System is a component of software configuration management that changes documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other information. Changes to these websites and documents are usually identified by a number or code, which is called the revision. Version control system is most commonly run as a stand alone application, but it can also be embedded in various kinds of software like Microsoft word or spreadsheets. Revision control is what lets a document be revised to its original revision. Revision control is an excellent way to combat the problem of sharing files with others. Some of the top open source version control systems are CVS, SVN, GIT, Mercurial, and more!

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system that is used for tracking changes in computer files and coordination work on files among multiple people. It’s mostly used for source code management, but it also can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 because of the development in Linux Kernal. It’s current maintained is Junio Hamano and has been there since 2005. Every git directory on every computer is repository with complete history and full version tracking abilities. Git’s design was inspired by Bitkeeper and Monotone and now is one of the most popular VCS’s today.

            <p class="lead">Founded in 2008, GitHub is a web-based Git and internet hosting service. GitHub offers plans for private and free repositories on the same account which are usually used to host open-source software projects. As of April 2017, GitHub has about 20 million users and 57 million repositories, making it the largest host of source code in the world! It provides access control and features such as bug tracking, wikis, and task management for projects. Githubs platform opened 2007 and was launched in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanswrath, and PJ Hyett. Github is mostly used for code.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Basic git commands are exactly what they sound like: easy commands used in git. Git config sets configuration values for your user name, email, and more. Git init initializes a git repository in a new or existing project. Git add Adds files changes in your working directory to your index. Git commit Takes all of the changes written in the index, creates a new commit object pointing to it and sets the branch to point to that new commit. git branch Creates a new branch if a branch name is provided. There are many more basic git commands but these are just some of them!

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">How to learn git is an easy, simple process once you have all the steps down! Git is free and open sourced and unlike SVN, distributed. This makes the clone slower, but subsequent operations faster. First, create a project with a git hosting tool. Copy the project to your local machine. Add a file to your local repo and save. “Push” your changes. Make a change to your file with the hosting tools and commit. “Pull” the changes. Create a branch, make a change, commit the change. Open a “pull request” and “merge” your branch and that is all the steps to learning how git works!
